# MAIN API

This project aims to create a cost-effective, pay-per-use video game server hosting platform for small groups of friends. The platform supports games such as Minecraft, Valheim, and Palworld, allowing users to easily manage game servers without dealing with the complexities of AWS infrastructure. Users can start and stop AWS EC2 instances to minimize costs, with separate charges for operational resources and storage. The front-end is built using React, while the backend APIs are developed in Golang. Each game server runs within a Docker container on the EC2 instances, ensuring isolated and consistent environments.
